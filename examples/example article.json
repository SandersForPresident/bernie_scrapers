        "body": "Despite major advances in civil and political rights, our country still has a long way to go in addressing the issue of gender inequality. Many of the achievements that have been made for women\u2019s rights in the 20th century have been under attack by the Republican party \u2014 denying women control over their own bodies, preventing access to vital medical and social services, and blocking equal pay for equal work. We are not going back to the days when women had to risk their lives to end an unwanted pregnancy. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make, not the government. We are not going to allow the extreme right-wing to defund Planned Parenthood, we are going to expand it. Planned Parenthood provides vital healthcare services for millions of women, who rely on its clinics every year for affordable, quality health care services including cancer prevention, STI and HIV testing and general primary health care services. The current attempt to malign Planned Parenthood is part of a long-term smear campaign by people who want to deny women in this country the right to control their own bodies. We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to birth control. Incredibly, almost all of the Republicans in the Senate are in favor of giving any employer who provides health insurance, or any insurance company, the ability to deny coverage for contraception or any other kind of procedure if the employer had a \u201cmoral\u201d objection to it. That is unacceptable. We will not go back to the days when survivors of domestic violence had no access to services or recourse against their abusers, because domestic violence was swept under the rug, as a shameful, private issue. Worse yet, it was not so long ago that spousal abuse was legal in many states. We must expand services provided through the Violence Against Women Act and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, and fight any attempts to undermine these laws. We are not going back to the days when it was legal for women to be paid less for doing the same work as men. It is wrong that women working full-time only earn 78 cents for every dollar a man earns. We have got to move forward and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. And, not only are we going to expand policies that advance gender equality, we are going to fight to pass the long-overdue Equal Rights Amendment and vigorously defend the critical laws and programs which protect all working people in our country. At a time when elderly women are more likely than men to be living in poverty, not only do we say NO to cuts in Social Security, we will expand Social Security. When 35 million Americans lack health insurance, not only do we say NO to cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, we will expand these programs that are so important to families.",

The gender pay gap is even worse for women of color. Today, African American women earn just 64 cents for every dollar a white male earns, while the figure for Hispanic women is just 54 cents. As president, Sen. Sanders will sign the Paycheck Fairness Act into law to end wage discrimination based on gender. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Expand and protect the reproductive rights of women.</li></h5> \n  <p> Sen. Sanders has consistently fought against Republican attacks on the fundamental rights of women to control their own bodies. As president, Sen. Sanders would expand, not cut, funding for Planned Parenthood, the Title X family planning program, and other initiatives that protect women\u2019s health, access to contraception, and the availability of a safe and legal abortion. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Only nominate Supreme Court justices who support Roe v. Wade and the reproductive rights of women.</li></h5> \n  <p> As president, Sen. Sanders will only nominate Supreme Court justices who understand that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and recognize the rights of women to have access to family planning services. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Make quality childcare and Pre-K available to all Americans.</li></h5> \n  <p> Sen. Sanders is working on a plan to make high-quality childcare and Pre-K available to every American, regardless of income. It is unacceptable that the cost of a quality childcare program is out of reach for millions of Americans. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.</li></h5> \n  <p> According to the most recent statistics, women make up two-thirds of all minimum wage workers. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would significantly boost the wages of more than 15 million women and help close the gender wage gap. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Raise the tipped minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023.</li></h5> \n  <p> The federal tipped minimum wage of just $2.13 an hour hasn\u2019t been raised since 1991. More than two-thirds of tipped workers are women. Increasing the tipped minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023 would lift millions of women out of poverty and significantly reduce the gender pay gap. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Provide at least 12 weeks of paid family leave, 2 weeks of paid vacation, and one week of paid sick days to American workers.</li></h5> \n  <p> As president, Sen. Sanders would end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee paid leave to workers. The Republicans talk a lot about \u201cfamily values.\u201d Well, it is not a family value to force the mother of a new born baby to go back to work a few days after she gives birth, because she doesn\u2019t have the money to stay home and bond with her baby. That is not a family value. That is an insult to everything that we know a family is about. Sen. Sanders would require employers to provide at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. At a time when over 65 percent of women work more than 40 hours a week, we must require employers to provide at least two weeks of paid vacation. And, we must require employers to provide at least one week of paid sick leave so that women can stay home to take care of a sick child, among other things. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Expand the WIC program for pregnant mothers and infants.</li></h5> \n  <p> As the Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Sen. Sanders helped lead the effort in the Senate against Republican attempts to cut the WIC program that provides nutrition assistance to pregnant mothers, women, and infants. As president, Sen. Sanders would substantially increase funding for this program so that every low-income mother and her children receive the nutrition they need to live healthy lives. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Make healthcare a right.</li></h5> \n  <p> As president, Sen. Sanders would fight for a Medicare for All single-payer healthcare system to make healthcare a right for all Americans. If the United States joined every major country on earth and enacted a universal healthcare program, women would benefit the most. Today, women have much higher healthcare expenses than men and pay a greater portion of their healthcare costs out of their own pockets. Women make up two-thirds of the low-wage workforce and only about 23 percent of low-wage jobs provide health insurance. It is time for a Medicare for All single-payer healthcare system. </p>\n  <h5> <li>Expand Social Security.</li></h5> \n  <p> As president, Sen. Sanders will fight to expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month; increase cost-of-living-adjustments to keep up with rising medical and prescription drug costs; and expand the minimum Social Security benefit to lift seniors out of poverty. Women will benefit the most by expanding Social Security. More than twice as many elderly women lived in poverty than men in 2013. Without Social Security, nearly half of all elderly women would be living in poverty. </p>\n </ol> \n</article> \n<nav class=\"pagination\"> \n <h5 class=\"previous\"><a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/fair-and-humane-immigration-policy/\" rel=\"prev\">A Fair and Humane Immigration Policy</a></h5> \n <h5 class=\"next\"><a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice/\" rel=\"next\">Racial Justice</a></h5> \n</nav> \n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div> \n<script>\n\n\t\t\t$('header').addClass('custom');\n\t\t\tvar newStyle = '<style type=\"text/css\">body.single > header.custom{ background-image: url(\"https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20150814_Bernie_WingDing-6675.jpg\");}@media (min-width: 768px) {body.single > header.custom{ background-image: url(\"https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/20150814_Bernie_WingDing-6675.jpg\");}}</style>';\n\t\t\t$(newStyle).appendTo('head');\n\n\t\t</script> <h2>Are you ready?</h2> \n<hr /> \n<form name=\"signup\" class=\"bsd-signup-29\" action=\"https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/join\" method=\"post\" id=\"signup\"> \n <label>Email Address</label> \n <input type=\"email\" class=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email Address\" /> \n <label>Zip Code</label> \n <input id=\"zip\" name=\"zip\" class=\"zip\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Zip Code\" /> \n <div style=\"display: none\">\n  <label for=\"best-contact-time\">Please leave this field blank:</label> \n  <input id=\"best-contact-time\" name=\"best-contact-time\" type=\"text\" />\n </div> \n <input name=\"submit-btn\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Join Us\" /> \n <input name=\"redirect_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\n <input id=\"_guid\" name=\"_guid\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" /> \n</form>",
